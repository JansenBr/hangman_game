<h3>Hangman word guessing game</h3>

This project is a terminal based word guessing game.

A random word is chosen from the word_list.txt file, and then the player have to guess the word letter by letter, in a total of 7 wrong guesses.
In case you run out of guesses the hangman will appear and its game over.

Make sure to run it on a large terminal window to be able to see the complete ascii art.

Have fun!
